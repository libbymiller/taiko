Install dependencies

    brew install ffmpeg
    npm install --save web-audio-engine 

    npm install -g node-static

See scripts/README.md to generate the files. You need to have some mp3s to make it work (in /sounds)

Then run the server:

    static -p 8000

use 'l' to navigate, 'r' to select, 'b' to go back.
